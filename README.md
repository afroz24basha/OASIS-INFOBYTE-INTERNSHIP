# Task - 1 (Voice Assistant)

Create a basic voice assistant that can perform simple tasks based on voice commands. Implement features like responding to "Hello" and providing predefined responses, telling the time or date, and searching the web or information based on user queries.

# Key Concepts and Challenges:

1. Speech Recognition: Learn how to recognize and process voice commands using speech recognition libraries or APIs.
2. User Interaction: Create a user-friendly interaction design that allows users to communicate with the assistant via voice commands.
3. Error Handling: Handle potential issues with voice recognition, network requests, or task execution.

# Task - 2 (BMI Calculator)

Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and category to the user.

# Key Concepts and Challenges:

1. User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully.
2. BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.
3. Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.
4. GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays.

# Task - 3 (Random Password Generator)

Create a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.

# Key Concepts and Challenges:

1. Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
2. User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
3. Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
